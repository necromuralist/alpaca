#+TITLE: Packet Capture
An attempt to create a generic interface for wireless packet capturing as I try different programs. It assumes that you're using a debian-based system. I use Ubuntu so whatever I document will be based on that.

* Installation
** Dependencies
   There are two dependencies, [[http://www.tcpdump.org/][tcpdump]] and [[https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airmon-ng][airmon-ng]]. =airmon-ng= puts the interface into monitor mode and =tcpdump= is doing the capture. =airmon-ng= is part of the =aircrack-ng= suite so when you install that it will pull in =airmon-ng= with it.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo apt install tcpdump
sudo apt install aircrack-ng
#+END_EXAMPLE
   
* Tests
  To run the tests you need [[https://github.com/sstephenson/bats][bats]]. If you are on a debian-based system you can install it with apt.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo apt install bats
#+END_EXAMPLE

Otherwise download their repository and put the =bats= file in your =PATH=.

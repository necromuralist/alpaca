* Background
  These are the 802.11 frame types and sub-types you can use to help filter out packets. The types and sub-types are represented in the frames as integers (well, really bits), but it's usually easier to remember the names (maybe).

* Types
  There are three main types that you need.

  | Name       | Identifier |
  |------------+------------|
  | Management |          0 |
  | Control    |          1 |
  | Data       |          2 |

* Sub-Types
  Within each of the types there are sub-types to identify what kind of frames they are. There are a lot of them so I'm only going to list the ones that I think are the most useful right now.

* Management

| Name                                           | Identifier |
|------------------------------------------------+------------|
| Association Request                            |          0 |
| Association Response                           |          1 |
| Reassociation Request                          |          2 |
| Reassociation Response                         |          3 |
| Probe Request                                  |          4 |
| Probe Response                                 |          5 |
| /Reserved/                                     |          6 |
| /Reserved/                                     |          7 |
| Beacon                                         |          8 |
| Announcement Traffic Indication Message (ATIM) |          9 |
| Disassociate                                   |         10 |
| Authentication                                 |         11 |
| Deauthentication                               |         12 |

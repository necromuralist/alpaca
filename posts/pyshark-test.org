* Introduction
  This is a first look at [[https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark][pyshark]]. Since I'm mostly interested in WiFi I'm going to look at that here. Before this code is run I put it in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_mode][monitor mode]] using [[https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airmon-ng][airmon-ng]] a shell-script to help you do this.
* Imports
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session pyshark :results none
import pyshark
#+END_SRC
* The Readme Example
  This first example is taken from the [[https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark][repository]] README file.
** Reading the Packets
